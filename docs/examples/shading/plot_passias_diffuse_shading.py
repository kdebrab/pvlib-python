Diffuse Self-Shading
====================

Modeling the reduction in diffuse irradiance caused by row-to-row diffuse
shading.
"""

# %%
# The term "self-shading" usually refers to adjacent rows blocking direct
# irradiance and casting shadows on each other. However, the concept also
# applies to diffuse irradiance because rows block a portion of the sky
# dome even when the sun is high in the sky. The irradiance loss fraction
# depends on how tightly the rows are packed and where on the module the
# loss is evaluated -- a point near the top of edge of a module will see
# more of the sky than a point near the bottom edge.
#
# This example uses the approach presented by Passias and K채llb채ck in [1]_
# and recreates two figures from that paper using
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.masking_angle_passias` and
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.sky_diffuse_passias`.
#
# However, the pvlib-python authors believe that this approach is incorrect.
# A correction is suggested and compared with the diffuse shading as obtained
# with the view factor model.

# First we'll recreate Figure 4, showing how the average masking angle varies
# with array tilt and array packing. The masking angle of a given point on a
# module is the angle from horizontal to the next row's top edge and represents
# the portion of the sky dome blocked by the next row. Because it changes
# from the bottom to the top of a module, the average across the module is
# calculated. In [1]_, ``k`` refers to the ratio of row pitch to row slant
# height (i.e. 1 / GCR).

# %%
# So as the array is packed tighter (decreasing ``k``), the average masking
# angle increases.
#
# Next we'll recreate Figure 5. Note that the y-axis here is the ratio of
# diffuse plane of array irradiance (after accounting for shading) to diffuse
# horizontal irradiance. This means that the deviation from 100% is due to the
# combination of self-shading and the fact that being at a tilt blocks off
# the portion of the sky behind the row. Following the approach detailed in
# [1]_, the first effect would be modeled with
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.sky_diffuse_passias` and the second with
# :py:func:`pvlib.irradiance.isotropic`.

# %%
# As ``k`` decreases, GCR increases, so self-shading loss increases and
# collected diffuse irradiance decreases.

# However, The pvlib-python authors believe that this approach is incorrect.
# Instead, the combination of self-shading and the fact that being at a tilt
# blocks off the portion of the sky behind the row is obtained by applying
# :py:func:`pvlib.shading.sky_diffuse_passias` on the sum of the masking and
# surface tilt angles (see dashed curves in below figure). The difference with
# the above approach is marginal for a ground coverage ratios of 10%, but
# becomes very significant for high ground coverage ratios. Alternatively,
# one can also use :py:func:`bifacial.utils.vf_row_sky_2d_integ` (see dotted
# curve in below figure), with very similar results except for the highest
# ground coverage ratio. It is believed that the deviation is a result of
# an approximation in :py:func:`pvlib.shading.masking_angle_passias` and that
# :py:func:`bifacial.utils.vf_row_sky_2d_integ` provides the most accurate
# result.
